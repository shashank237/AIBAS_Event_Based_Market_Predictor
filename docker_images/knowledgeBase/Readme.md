Created for the course "M. Grum: Advanced AI-based Application Systems" by the Junior Chair for Business Information Science, esp. AI-based Application Systems at the University of Potsdam.

Image Purpose  
This Docker image represents the knowledge base of the AI system.  
It contains the trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, the trained Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model, and the corresponding feature scaler required for inference.

Model Description  
The ANN model was trained using TensorFlow, while the OLS model was trained using the Statsmodels library.  
Both models were trained on the same dataset to enable a performance comparison between AI-based and statistical approaches.
